<h1>Integrated Management System for the Global Healthcare Ecosystem</h1>

Absolutely! Below is an expanded and more detailed version of the business requirements for the **Electronic Patient Card**, with each requirement elaborated to include complex business rules and conditions.

## Comprehensive Business Requirements for Electronic Patient Card

### 1. Patient Profile Management
- **Requirement 1.1: Unique Identifier Validation**
    - Each patient must be assigned a unique identifier (e.g., Social Security Number, National ID) upon registration to ensure that every patient can be distinctly identified in the healthcare system. The system must validate that the identifier does not already exist in the database when creating a new patient profile. If a duplicate identifier is detected, the system must prevent the creation of the new profile and display an error message that clearly indicates the conflict, suggesting the user verify the identifier. Additionally, if a patient is registered without an identifier, the system must flag the profile for review, preventing any further actions until the identifier is provided. In cases where the identifier needs to be updated, the system must enforce that only authorized personnel can make such changes, and any alteration must trigger an audit log entry detailing the change for compliance purposes.

- **Requirement 1.2: Profile Completeness**
    - A patient profile must include mandatory fields: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Contact Information (phone number and email), and Emergency Contact. The system must enforce strict validation rules to prevent saving a profile if any mandatory fields are missing; if any required field is left blank, the system must display a specific error message indicating which fields need to be completed. Furthermore, the system must validate that the Date of Birth entered results in a patient age that is greater than 0 years; if a future date is entered, the system must prompt the user to correct it. If the patient's age is over 18, the system must allow the addition of an emergency contact; if under 18, the emergency contact must be a parent or guardian, and the system must validate that the emergency contact's phone number is in a valid format (e.g., 10 digits for US numbers). Additionally, the system must require that the emergency contact's relationship to the patient is specified (e.g., Mother, Father, Guardian), and this field should be a dropdown with predefined options to ensure consistency.

- **Requirement 1.3: Data Consistency Rules**
    - The system must ensure that all entries in the patient profile are consistent with existing data; for example, if a patient's gender is updated, the system must check for any related fields that may also need to be updated (e.g., preferred pronouns). If a patient’s marital status is marked as "Married," the system should prompt for the spouse's name and contact information as optional fields, ensuring that relevant family information is captured. The system must validate that the email address entered follows a standard email format (e.g., user@example.com) and must not allow the use of temporary or disposable email addresses; if such an address is detected, the system must prompt the user to enter a valid email. Additionally, any changes made to the profile must trigger a notification to the patient via their preferred communication method (email or SMS), informing them of the update, and the system must provide a mechanism for patients to acknowledge receipt of this notification.

- **Requirement 1.4: Profile Update Restrictions**
    - Only users with roles designated as "Healthcare Provider" or "Administrator" can update patient profiles; the system must maintain a role-based access control mechanism to enforce this restriction. Changes to critical fields (e.g., Date of Birth, Gender) must require a secondary confirmation from a supervisor or a designated approver, and the system must log all such requests and approvals for accountability. The system must prevent changes to the profile during specific times, such as during scheduled maintenance or when the patient is undergoing a critical procedure, until a designated time frame has passed. Furthermore, the system must allow patients to request updates to their profiles through the patient portal, but such requests must be reviewed and approved by authorized personnel before being applied to ensure accuracy and compliance.

- **Requirement 1.5: Historical Record Maintenance**
    - The system must maintain a complete historical record of all changes made to the patient profile, including original values, new values, timestamps, and user IDs of those making the changes. This historical record must be immutable and stored securely, ensuring that changes can be audited without risk of alteration. Users must be able to access this history to understand how and when patient information has changed, with the ability to filter records by date range and type of change (e.g., profile update, emergency contact change). The system must provide a mechanism for generating reports on profile changes over a specified period, allowing administrators to review trends in data modifications, and if a patient profile is marked as inactive or deleted, the historical records must still be retained for a specified retention period (e.g., 7 years) to comply with legal and regulatory requirements.

### 2. Medical History Management
- **Requirement 2.1: Medical History Entry Validation**
    - Each medical history entry must include the following fields: Date, Description, Provider Name, Type of Entry (e.g., Diagnosis, Surgery), and Notes. The system must validate that the Date of the entry is not a future date; if a future date is entered, the system must prompt the user to correct it and provide a specific error message. The Provider Name must be selected from a dropdown list of authorized providers to ensure consistency and accuracy, and if the provider is not listed, the system must flag the entry for review. If the Description field is left blank, the system must prompt the user to provide a reason for the entry, and this reason must be logged for auditing purposes. Additionally, the system must allow for the attachment of supporting documents (e.g., previous medical records, test results) when entering new medical history to provide context for the entries.

- **Requirement 2.2: Conflict Detection**
    - When adding a new medical history entry, the system must check for conflicts with existing entries, such as overlapping treatment dates or contradictory diagnoses. If a patient has a diagnosis of a condition, the system should flag any new entries that suggest a different diagnosis for the same condition without appropriate context. If a conflict is detected, the system must display a warning message and require the user to confirm or modify the new entry before saving, with the user required to provide justification for any conflicting entries. The system must also allow users to attach supporting documents (e.g., previous medical records, test results) when entering new medical history to provide context for conflicting information. Furthermore, the system must track the frequency of conflicting entries and alert administrators if a particular patient has a pattern of conflicting information that requires review.

- **Requirement 2.3: Versioning and Audit Trail**
    - The system must maintain a version history for each medical history entry, capturing changes made, including timestamps and user IDs. Each version must be retrievable for review, and users must be able to view the history of changes made to each entry, including the reason for changes if provided. The system must generate alerts for significant changes in medical history that may impact ongoing treatment (e.g., new allergies, major surgeries) and notify relevant healthcare providers. Additionally, the system must allow users to compare different versions of an entry side-by-side to facilitate understanding of changes over time, and any entry that has been modified must be flagged for review during patient consultations.

- **Requirement 2.4: Categorization of Medical History**
    - The system must allow categorization of medical history entries (e.g., Past Medical History, Family History, Social History) to facilitate easier navigation and retrieval of information. Users must be able to filter and search medical history entries based on these categories, with the ability to combine filters (e.g., search for all entries under "Past Medical History" within a specific date range). The system must provide a summary view of the patient’s medical history, highlighting key categories and the most recent entries for quick reference by healthcare providers. Additionally, the system must allow for the tagging of entries with keywords to enhance searchability, and users must be able to generate reports based on categorized data for analysis.

### 3. Medication Management
- **Requirement 3.1: Medication Interaction Checks**
    - The system must automatically check for potential drug interactions when adding or updating medications. The interaction check must include interactions with existing medications, known allergies, and dietary restrictions. If an interaction is detected, the system must display a warning message detailing the nature of the interaction, its severity (e.g., mild, moderate, severe), and recommended actions. The user must acknowledge the warning before proceeding, and the system must log the acknowledgment along with the user ID and timestamp. Additionally, the system must provide educational resources related to identified interactions, allowing healthcare providers to access relevant clinical guidelines and alternative medication options.

- **Requirement 3.2: Adherence Tracking**
    - Patients must be able to log their medication adherence, indicating whether they took their medications as prescribed. The system must allow for daily, weekly, or monthly logging based on the prescribed regimen, and patients should receive reminders to log their adherence. If a patient reports a missed dose, the system must require the patient to provide a reason for non-adherence; the reasons must be selectable from a predefined list (e.g., forgot, side effects, unavailability). The system must allow healthcare providers to view adherence logs and reasons for missed doses, generating reports on adherence trends over time. If a patient reports consistent non-adherence (e.g., more than three missed doses within a month), the system must automatically flag the patient for follow-up by the healthcare provider, and the provider must be required to document the follow-up actions taken.

- **Requirement 3.3: Medication Review Alerts**
    - The system must generate alerts for healthcare providers when a patient has not had a medication review in the last 12 months. Alerts must specify the date of the last review and the medications that require reassessment, and the system must allow providers to configure their notification preferences. Providers must be prompted to schedule a medication reconciliation appointment to review the patient's current medications, with the system suggesting optimal times based on the provider's schedule. The system must allow providers to document the outcome of the medication review, including any changes made to the medication regimen and the rationale for those changes, ensuring that all decisions are recorded for future reference.

- **Requirement 3.4: Historical Medication Records**
    - The system must maintain a historical record of all medications prescribed to the patient, including start and end dates, dosage changes, reasons for discontinuation, and prescribing provider. Users must be able to access this history to understand the patient’s medication journey, with options to filter by date range, medication type, or prescribing provider. The system must allow providers to annotate historical medication records with notes regarding the patient’s response to medications, providing context for future treatment decisions. Additionally, the system must generate reports on medication usage patterns over time, helping providers identify trends and make informed decisions about ongoing treatment.

### 4. Allergy and Adverse Reaction Management
- **Requirement 4.1: Allergy Documentation Rules**
    - When documenting an allergy, the system must require the following fields: Allergen, Reaction Type, Severity, and Date of Onset. The Reaction Type must be selected from a predefined list (e.g., Rash, Anaphylaxis), and the system must validate that the severity is chosen from predefined options (e.g., Mild, Moderate, Severe). If the Date of Onset is not provided, the system must prompt the user to enter it, and the system should allow users to indicate if the allergy is ongoing or resolved. The system must also allow for the documentation of cross-reactivity, enabling users to specify if the allergy to one substance also applies to others (e.g., penicillin and related antibiotics). Additionally, the system must provide a mechanism for healthcare providers to review and confirm allergy entries periodically, ensuring that the information remains accurate and up-to-date.

- **Requirement 4.2: Alert Mechanism for Allergies**
    - The system must automatically alert healthcare providers when a patient with known allergies is prescribed a medication that could cause an adverse reaction. Alerts must be generated in real-time during the prescribing process and must include specific details about the allergy (e.g., allergen name, reaction type), the medication prescribed, and recommended alternative medications. Providers must be required to acknowledge the alert before proceeding with the prescription, and the system must log the acknowledgment along with the user ID and timestamp. Additionally, the system must allow providers to document their rationale for overriding allergy alerts, including the potential benefits of the prescribed medication and any monitoring plans, ensuring that all decisions are recorded for future reference.

- **Requirement 4.3: Resolution of Allergies**
    - Providers must be able to document resolved allergies, including the date of resolution and any relevant notes. The system must allow for the documentation of follow-up assessments to confirm resolution, and once marked as resolved, the allergy should remain in the patient’s history for reference but should not trigger alerts during medication prescribing. The system must provide a mechanism for periodic review of resolved allergies, prompting providers to reassess and confirm the status of these allergies at least once every two years. Additionally, the system must track the frequency of resolved allergies and generate reports for providers to review patterns in allergy resolution over time.

### 5. Test Results Management
- **Requirement 5.1: Test Result Entry Requirements**
    - Each test result must include the following fields: Test Date, Test Type, Result, and Interpreting Provider. The Test Type must be selected from a predefined list of common tests (e.g., CBC, MRI, X-ray), and the system must validate that the Test Date is not a future date. If a future date is entered, the system must prompt the user to correct it and provide a specific error message. If the Result field is left blank, the system must prompt the user to provide the result before saving. The system must also allow for the attachment of related documents (e.g., test requisitions, images) to each test result for comprehensive record-keeping, ensuring that all relevant information is easily accessible.

- **Requirement 5.2: Abnormal Result Notification**
    - The system must automatically notify healthcare providers when a test result falls outside predefined normal ranges. The notification must include the test name, result, normal range, and any relevant clinical guidelines for follow-up. Notifications must be sent in real-time and should be accessible through the provider’s dashboard, with options for providers to configure their notification preferences (e.g., email, SMS). The system must allow providers to document their follow-up actions based on abnormal results, including referrals to specialists or additional testing, and these actions must be logged for future reference.

- **Requirement 5.3: Patient Access to Results**
    - Patients must have access to their test results through a secure patient portal, with the portal designed to be user-friendly and provide clear explanations for each result, including visual aids where applicable (e.g., graphs for trends). The system must allow patients to request clarification or additional information from their healthcare providers regarding test results, with requests logged and tracked for timely responses. Additionally, the system must provide educational resources related to specific test results, helping patients understand the implications and next steps, and must allow patients to share their results with family members or caregivers through secure channels.

- **Requirement 5.4: Test Result Historical Tracking**
    - The system must maintain a historical record of all test results, allowing healthcare providers to track changes over time and identify trends in the patient’s health status. Users must be able to visualize test result trends through graphs or charts, with options to filter by date range or test type. The system must allow providers to annotate historical test results with notes regarding the patient’s response or any relevant clinical decisions made based on the results, ensuring that all context is preserved for future consultations. Additionally, the system must generate reports on test result trends over time, helping providers identify patterns and make informed decisions about ongoing patient care.

### 6. Access Control and Security
- **Requirement 6.1: Role-Based Access Control**
    - The system must implement role-based access controls to restrict access to patient data based on user roles (e.g., Patient, Provider, Administrator). Each role must have predefined permissions that dictate what data can be viewed or modified, ensuring that sensitive information is only accessible to authorized personnel. Users must only be able to view and edit data relevant to their role; for example, patients must not have access to sensitive provider notes or other patients' information. The system must allow administrators to define and modify roles and permissions as needed, with changes logged for auditing purposes. Additionally, the system must provide a mechanism for periodic review of user roles and access levels to ensure compliance with organizational policies.

- **Requirement 6.2: Session Timeout and Re-authentication**
    - The system must automatically log out users after a period of inactivity (e.g., 15 minutes) to protect patient data from unauthorized access. The timeout duration must be configurable by system administrators, allowing for adjustments based on organizational needs. Users must be required to re-authenticate after timeout to access patient information again, and the system must provide a clear warning before logging out to allow users to extend their session if needed. If a user attempts to access the system after being logged out, they must be prompted to enter their credentials again, and the system must log the attempt for security auditing.

- **Requirement 6.3: Data Encryption Standards**
    - All patient data must be encrypted both in transit (e.g., during data transmission over the internet) and at rest (e.g., stored in databases) using industry-standard encryption protocols (e.g., AES-256). The system must ensure compliance with relevant regulations regarding data protection and patient privacy, including regular audits and assessments of security measures. The system must implement logging mechanisms to track access to encrypted data, ensuring that any unauthorized access attempts are recorded and investigated. Additionally, the system must provide mechanisms for securely sharing patient data with authorized third parties, ensuring that encryption is maintained throughout the sharing process.

- **Requirement 6.4: Two-Factor Authentication**
    - The system should implement two-factor authentication (2FA) for all users accessing sensitive patient data, adding an additional layer of security. Users must provide a second form of verification (e.g., SMS code, authentication app) in addition to their password to access the system. The system must allow users to configure their preferred method of 2FA and provide recovery options for users who lose access to their 2FA method. Additionally, the system must log all 2FA attempts, including successful and failed attempts, for auditing purposes, and must notify users of any suspicious login attempts.

### 7. Patient Engagement Features
- **Requirement 7.1: Patient Portal Functionality**
    - Patients must be able to log into a secure portal to view their electronic patient card, medical history, medications, and test results. The portal must be designed to be user-friendly and accessible on various devices (desktop, mobile) to accommodate diverse patient needs. The system must provide options for patients to update their contact information and manage communication preferences, with changes made by patients logged and reviewed by authorized personnel before being applied. The system must allow patients to set preferences for how they receive notifications (e.g., email, SMS) regarding test results, appointment reminders, and medication refill alerts, ensuring that patients receive timely information in their preferred format.
